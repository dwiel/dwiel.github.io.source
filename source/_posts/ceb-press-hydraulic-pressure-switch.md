Just spent an hour or two looking for low cost pressure switches to use on the CEB Press.  I would like to add them as a way to add reliable sensing of end cylinder stopping points.  This avoids the need for external sensors to determine when to stop primary and secondary movements.  I will still need sensors to know when the primary cylinder should stop growing the compression chamber as well as one to know when the secondary cylinder should stop for a compression stage.  However, with just 2 sensors instead of 6, it should be a fair bit simpler to use physical switches instead of the unreliable hall effect sensors.

The sensor I found to use is [this one](http://ecatalog.gemssensors.com/ecatalog/pressure-switches/en/209667 "this one").  It is $32 adjustable from 1000-3000 psi and rated for maximum 6000 psi overload.

There is one at the surplus center [here](https://www.surpluscenter.com/item.asp?item=9-6278&amp;catname=hydraulic "here"), but the one they sent me was used and broken, there is no datasheet that exactly matches what they sell and there are only 3 left in stock which means that they aren't going to be able to be used by many more people.  I'd rather find a solution that can be easily replicated.
