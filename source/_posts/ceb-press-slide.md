I couldn't find any cheap conveyors around here that had rollers that were close enough together to work for the CEBs. I found and bought one conveyor, but the rollers are too far apart, and so the blocks bounce around rather than roll smoothly. Instead of spending a hundreds or thousands of dollars for a new conveyor, we built this slide with a large 2x12, some 2x2s and some stainless steel flashing, and it has been working well:

Concrete blocks, CEBs and wood hold the slide up at the right height. A heavy block is placed at the end of the slide to keep it from getting pushed away from press when it gets full. We had a few accidents where the whole slide fell over when it got really full and we didn't have a weight at the end.
