We've been discussing the materials used in our new house and are pretty set on not using any plastic.  However, there are a few key places where it might be extremely helpful so I decided to look into how bad it really is (from a carbon footprint perspective).  I am still strongly opposed to having exposed plastic that would off-gas and degrade into the air, but if it is built into the structure maybe I wouldn't mind quite so much.  Here are the numbers I came up with:

- 600 square feet of 6 mil plastic &rarr; 100 kilowatt hours of electricity
- 100' of 3/4" PEX tubing &rarr; 45 kilowatt hours of electricity

This is only counting the manufacture of the materials I believe, not the transport of the finished product.  for a reference point, our current house uses about ~120 kilowatt hours of electricity per month.  The average home in the US uses about 800 kilowatt hours.  This will be helpful in determining when we want to use plastic.
