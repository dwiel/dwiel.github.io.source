We have multiple wheelbarrows for moving blocks from the [slide](http://dwiel.net/blog/ceb-press-slide) to the [pallets](http://dwiel.net/blog/ceb-tarping) where we store them, but this one is the easiest and lightest. The bucket of a standard wheel barrow was removed and these pieces of wood were screwed on in its place. I'm not sure it would be worth removing the bucket from an otherwise functioning wheelbarrow, but this one is definitely easier to use than the others.
