I keep getting emails asking to please visit this website and vote for Obama, or sign up to this Obama facebook group.  I like Obama and I plan on voting for him, I really do.  I like showing my support for him and letting anyone who is interested know what I think.  However, I could spend every hour of the day joining Obama facebook groups and voting for him in various polls.  This is not a productive use of my time.  I want to publish the fact that I support Obama, and be done with it.  Let this be the informal declaration.  I hope to have a framework which would allow people to make declarations of this type, which could then be read and understood by computers, and then analyzed and viewed by anyone and everyone who is interested.  There could even be a facebook/myspace app. *sigh* Say it once, have it published, and moveon.
