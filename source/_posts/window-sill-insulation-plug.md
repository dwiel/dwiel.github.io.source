Awesome idea for later:

Cast a 3" or larger [tap](http://www.nmri.go.jp/eng/khirata/metalwork/basic/bolt/index_e.html) to cut large threads into window sill. Make same size threaded wooden plug that can screw in tightly. Remove plug to check on insulation in the sill.  Alternatively, could hold a wooden block in place that makes a perfect fit in a square hole and use embedded magnets to pull it out.

This can all be done later though.  We could start by leaving it sealed up and drilling/cutting a hole in it later to check on things.
