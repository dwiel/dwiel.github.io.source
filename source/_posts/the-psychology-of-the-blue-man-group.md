There is a great [video](http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge262.html#4 "video") over at edge about how talking about old age makes people walk slower and asking people to nod yes or no while demoing headphones influences their opinions on the headphones' quality.  I think the [Blue Man Group](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS-4stj8fQ) was ahead of their time.
